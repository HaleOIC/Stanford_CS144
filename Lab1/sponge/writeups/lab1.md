This lab took me about [n] hours to do. I [did/did not] attend the lab session.

Program Structure and Design of the StreamReassembler:

Implementation Challenges:
At first, I do not understand why there is a question about the overlaping substring.
It blocks my way to the correct answer, while I realize that it is ambiguous,for each slice
is being resent when the reciever is giving back the feedback.
So it can not generate the overlaping substring.
